# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship Task 5. The goal was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that influence passenger survival.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze the Titanic dataset using statistical and visual exploration techniques to answer key questions like:
- Who were more likely to survive?
- Did gender, age, or class influence survival?
- Were there any notable trends or patterns in the data?

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – data manipulation
  - `numpy` – numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization

## 📊 Key Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Overview**
   - Checked for data types, missing values, and initial stats.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values in `Age` and `Embarked`
   - Dropped irrelevant columns like `Cabin`, `Name`, `Ticket`
   - Converted categorical columns to proper datatypes

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created `AgeGroup`, `FamilySize`, and `IsAlone` features

4. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Studied distribution of Age, Fare, Survival, Pclass

5. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Analyzed relationships between `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Age` vs `Survived`

6. **Multivariate Correlation**
   - Created heatmap of numeric correlations

7. **Final Summary**
   - Summarized all meaningful patterns and insights

## 🔍 Insights & Observations

- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
- Children (especially under 12) had better survival chances.
- Higher fare tickets correlated with higher survival.
- Passengers traveling alone had lower survival probability.
